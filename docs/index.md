# Wat iz dis?

Well this is just a little site I wrote in my spare time to hopefully help other people with various things. I'm not a professional programmer or anything, I just like to tinker with things and learn new things. I'm not a professional writer either, so I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes. If you find any mistakes/improvements, write an git isse here -> [click me](https://github.com/Dschogo/HowToStuff/issues)

# What can I find here?

More or less anything, see for yourself, in the sidebar.
