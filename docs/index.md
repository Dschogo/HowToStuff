## Wat iz dis?

Well this is just a little site I wrote in my spare time to hopefully help other people with various things. I'm not a professional programmer or anything, I just like to tinker with things and learn new things. I'm not a professional writer either, so I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes. If you find any mistakes/improvements regarding text and ofc the content, create a git issue here -> [click me](https://github.com/Dschogo/HowToStuff/issues)

## What can I find here?

All sorts of tips little tools and howto's for technical stuff. Just look around in the tabs above and on the left.
